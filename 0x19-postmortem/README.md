# Outage Postmortem: Cloud Service Disruption

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** June 15, 2023, 10:20 - June 15, 2023, 14:40 (UTC)
- **Impact:** Cloud file-sharing service experienced a 4-hour outage, affecting all users.

## Timeline
- **Detected:** June 15, 2023, 10:20 (UTC)
- **Detection:** Monitoring tools raised alerts on service unavailability.
- **Actions Taken:** Initial suspicion on backend server load, scaled resources.
- **Misleading Paths:** Investigated database performance and network latency.
- **Escalation:** Raised the incident to System Operations and Database teams.
- **Resolution:** June 15, 2023, 14:40 (UTC), after identifying a code regression in the latest deployment.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Cause:** A code regression introduced in the latest deployment triggered a deadlock in the backend, halting service responses.
- **Resolution:** Development team rolled back the deployment, restoring service functionality.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  1. Strengthen testing procedures for code deployments.
  2. Implement automated deadlock detection in critical backend components.
  3. Enhance incident escalation path to involve developers early.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Revise code deployment checklist to include thorough regression tests (Development).
  2. Integrate deadlock detection mechanisms into backend monitoring (DevOps).
  3. Update incident response protocols to ensure developer involvement (DevOps, System Operations).

## Postmortem
**Issue Summary:**  
Our cloud file-sharing service experienced a widespread outage on June 15, 2023, lasting 4 hours and affecting all users. The incident was a result of a code regression causing backend deadlocks.

**Timeline:**  
At 10:20 (UTC) on June 15, 2023, our monitoring tools alerted us to the service's unavailability. Initial suspicions centered around backend server load issues, prompting us to scale up resources. However, subsequent investigations into database performance and network latency proved misleading.

The incident was escalated to the System Operations and Database teams, who identified the root cause by 14:40 (UTC). A code regression from the latest deployment triggered a deadlock in the backend, causing service responses to halt.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**  
The root cause was traced back to a code regression introduced in the recent deployment. This regression caused a deadlock in the backend, rendering the service unresponsive. To restore service functionality, the development team swiftly rolled back the problematic deployment.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**  
To prevent such incidents in the future, we've outlined the following corrective and preventative measures:

1. **Strengthen testing procedures:** The development team will enhance code deployment testing procedures, placing greater emphasis on regression tests to catch potential issues.
   
2. **Automated deadlock detection:** DevOps will integrate automated deadlock detection mechanisms into critical backend components to swiftly identify and address similar issues.
   
3. **Incident escalation involving developers:** Incident response protocols will be updated to ensure early involvement of developers, facilitating quicker diagnosis and resolution.

**Tasks:**  
To implement these measures, specific tasks have been defined:

1. **Revised code deployment checklist:** Development will update the code deployment checklist to include comprehensive regression tests.
   
2. **Deadlock detection integration:** DevOps will integrate deadlock detection mechanisms into backend monitoring tools.
   
3. **Incident response protocol update:** DevOps and System Operations will collaborate to update incident response protocols, ensuring developers are engaged promptly.

In conclusion, the cloud file-sharing service outage on June 15, 2023, was attributed to a code regression causing backend deadlocks. By improving testing procedures, introducing automated detection, and enhancing incident response, we strive to prevent similar occurrences and maintain seamless service for our users.
